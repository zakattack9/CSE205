  Description: Write examples for 5 different principles from the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice

1) Public:
Software engineers recently discovered a major virus that leaked user's information to a hacker, however they did not warn the public of the incident and instead continued work on fixing the virus.

2) Client and Employer:
A beginner software engineer accepted a client job to build an eCommerce website complete with a back-end, but had no experience in building out back-end architectures for eCommerce sites; the programmer didn't mention his experience-level to the client and instead got to work on the project.

3) Product:
A software engineer responsible for building out a search algorithm for a data visualization application, "finished" his algorithm knowing very well it could have been optimized for faster searches.

4) Judgement:
After landing a job with a wealthy client, the client sent the software engineer a bunch of media files including photos, icons, and logos; the programmer however, secretly sold a few icons on another website without the clients consent. 

7) Colleagues:
During the desiging phase of an application, two software engineers found themselves disagreeing on the UX layout of the main interface. Instead of coming to a compromise, the two engineers did not communicate with each other for the remainder of the project.
